    <h1>The beginner's guide to Web3- the Internet of the future.</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The statement that "Web3 is the future of the internet" is becoming more popular than ever, especially as more investors and developers concentrate their efforts to Web3, but what is Web3?</p>
     <br>
     <h2>What is Web3?</h2>
     <p>The term "Web3", also known as "Web3.0", was coined by the founder of Polkadot and co-founder of Ethereum in 2014, six years after the first application of blockchain (Bitcoin) was developed. Built by a certain Gavin Wood.

        Web3.0 is a decentralized version of the World Wide Web based on blockchain technology. It's a way of redistributing internet ownership. This means you have full control over your data and money, and don't have to worry about your privacy when using the internet.
        
        According to Josh Neuroth, "The whole point of web3 is to move responsibility and decision-making from small groups into the hands of communities."
        
        It is very important to note that Web 3.0 is still in its infancy. Web3 is not only based on blockchain, which most people pay attention to, but also decentralized machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. So anyone can access the data and train advanced AI.
        
        Big companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are collecting ernomous data, which is used to train AI in their commercialized products. This creates an unfair advantage over smaller startups.</p>
