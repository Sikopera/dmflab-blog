    <h1>Getting started with Blockchain- Blockchain 101</h1>
    <h5>Blockchain is a technology used in storing data which cannot be changed after they are created.</h5>
    <p>If you go to Google or look through your timeline, you will notice various advertisements from Cryptocurrency or Blockchain companies offering their services. The obvious question is, "Why Blockchain?" Why are big firms investing heavily in Blockchain? You're obviously eager to learn, as evidenced by your presence here.</p>
    <h2>Introduction to Blockchain</h2>
    <p>Blockchain is simply a chain of blocks just like the name is. It is a technology used in storing data which cannot be changed after they are created. In our present day world, when you create a file on your PC, you can decide to edit some documents- probably you remove or add information and then save again. In Blockchain it is not so easy to do because there are several PCs involved and these PCs (called nodes) have the same information on all of them without the presence of a central authority or server and it will require the unanimous approval of every PC on the network for a change to be effected.</p>
    <p>In addition, most Blockchain ledgers are immutable, that is, you can't edit, change or alter them, you can only add new information. Take for example, there are 10,000 PCs on a Blockchain network, imagine the load of work for one person or a group of persons to start hacking into each system one by one to edit the information on each system not to think of having to wait for the approval of other systems before you can edit a piece of information.</p>

    <p>However, an attack on the Blockchain like Bitcoin is possible once you have access to 51% of the nodes on the network (we will discuss attacks on the Blockchain at a later date).</p>
